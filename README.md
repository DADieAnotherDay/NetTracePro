# NetTracePro
NetTracePro is a powerful network analysis tool that combines ICMP probing and traceroute simulation to provide detailed insights into network latency, hop-by-hop route analysis, and geolocation information. It uses Scapy for packet crafting, requests for geolocation data, and matplotlib for visualization.
